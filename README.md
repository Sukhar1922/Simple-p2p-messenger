# Simple-p2p-messenger

A very simple p2p messenger with sockets. It runs on localhost with port 1922, but its running config is easy to change. The messenger has no opportunity to go to the global network :(

You should run server.py first, then client.py to connect each other (with your IP addresses if needed)
